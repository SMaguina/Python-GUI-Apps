# Python-GUI-Apps
Tkinter Graphical UI Application Scripts for Software Prototyping

Purpose: Create a functioning widget that can do the following:<br>
*Add new body of text
*Fetch stored content from sqlite3 database
*Display this content in a listbox grid
*Ability to select text entries on display and return them in entry field
*Use selected text entries to parse as HTML and automatically open a default web browser window

I created one initial draft of the specs using a pack geometry layout. Then I converted and switched over to a grid geometry layout for more functionality and modularity in selecting/returning the text entries.
