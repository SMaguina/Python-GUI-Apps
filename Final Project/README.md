Functional Sqlite scripts for Software Prototyping

Project purpose: Create a Dog Shelter database that is connected to sqlite3 and written in Python 2. The customized script can add, search, view all, and delete dog records within a text-based program. To visualize the user input workflow, a flowchart was created to brainstorm what the user will experience and output on each SQL command activated. The database table fields were also created to capture specifically the Name, Gender, Microchip #, and Breed of the dog.
