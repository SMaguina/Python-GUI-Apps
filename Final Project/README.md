Functional Sqlite scripts for Software Prototyping

The project's challenge was to visualize and program a user input workflow for a brand new dog shelter database. What I worked on specifically was on the creation of a dog shelter database that is connected to sqlite3 and written in Python 2. The customized script can add, search, view all, and delete dog records within a text-based program. To visualize the user input workflow from a user experience perspective, a flowchart was created to brainstorm what the user will experience and output on each SQL command activated. The database table fields were also created to capture specifically the Name, Gender, Microchip #, and Breed of the dog. As a result, a fully functional Terminal User Interface program was created and implemented with all the user input functionalities.
