wxPython and Tkinter Graphical UI Application Scripts for Software Prototyping

I was given real-world tasks on creating program scripts for problems that involved using both Python 2 and Python 3 as appropriate. I used an array of libraries and modules, along with GUI toolkits such as WxPython and Tkinter to create simple program prototypes. This is an archive of those program scripts I contributed to creating, along with their README file providing more information. The Coding Practicals folder includes coding practicals from drills done in courses.
