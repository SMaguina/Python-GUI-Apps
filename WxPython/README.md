wxPython Graphical UI Application Scripts for Software Prototyping

Purpose: Streamline a system that would take new or modified files and copy them into another file directory. The date and time would be stamped automatically after each run. So these scripts were created to prototype the UIâ€™s layout and construct the sqlite script to record the date/time stamps after each import. It has also been converted to Python 3 using 2to3 program.
